= Kakoune Configuration
Parasrah <github@parasrah.com>

== TODO

* `i3`
** [x] `terminal` opens in `i3` as vsplit at bottom
** [ ] focus the current client so terminal commands are relative to that client
** [ ] return split state to previous value after spawning new client
* `kitty`
** [ ] scope kitty window to instance where client resides (not where kak was spawned)
** [ ] allow opening program in `kitty` tab, sending edits to client (`connect.kak`)
* `fzf`
** [ ] make `fzf` open in kitty window (for speed)
* `nnn`
** [x] command to open specified directory as external i3 window in `nnn` (1..1)
** [ ] default above command to current buffer directory (0..1)
** [ ] `-` opens `nnn` in current shell, goes back to kak on close
** [ ] selecting file in `nnn` opens in same kakoune session
* `neovim` (make up for lacking LSP's with coc.nvim)
** [ ] command to open current buffer as external i3 window in neovim
** [ ] command to perform above in current shell, goes back to kak on close
* `csharp`
** [ ] syntax files
** [ ] autoindent
** [ ] comments
** [ ] build cmd
* `typescript`
** [ ] fix typescript syntax & comments
** [ ] build
** [x] lint
** [x] lsp
** [x] format
* `elm`
** [ ] remove `lsp` hack (blocked)
** [x] format
** [ ] elm-analyze
** [ ] build
* `elixir`
** [x] formatting
** [x] lsp
** [ ] lsp diagnostics
** [ ] stop lsp in insert mode?
* [ ] quickfix equivalent
* [ ] ignore `.git` in `fzf`
* [ ] make <c-w> delete wordwise in `fzf` mode
* [ ] left margin
* [x] lsp `k` for info, `K` for diagnostics
* [ ] highlight TODO, FIXME
* [ ] replicate `R` from vim
* [ ] use `Y` for copy (not yank)
* [ ] secure way of `source`-ing machine-specific configs (ex: to add plugins like `parasrah/csharp.kak`
** this might be a cool idea for an editor agnostic tool leveraging gpg
* [ ] auto-lint
* [ ] better contrast on selection?
* [ ] better insert mode indicator
