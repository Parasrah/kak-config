= Kakoune Configuration
Parasrah <github@parasrah.com>

== TODO

* [ ] `i3` integration
	* `terminal` opens in `i3` as vsplit at bottom
	* focus the current client so terminal commands are relative to that client
* [ ] `nnn` integration
	* `-` opens `nnn` in current directory
	* selecting file in `nnn` opens in same kakoune session
* [ ] `neovim` integration
	* command to open current buffer in neovim
	* when `neovim` closes, go back to `kakoune` session
	* would allow me to use `coc.nvim` to make up for lacking typescript language servers as necessary (imports, etc)
* [ ] csharp syntax files
* [ ] ignore `.git` in `fzf`
* [ ] make <c-w> delete wordwise in `fzf` mode
* [ ] left margin
* [ ] fix lsp `k` and `K`
* [ ] highlight TODO's
* [ ] replicate `R` from vim
* [ ] use `Y` for copy (not yank)
* [ ] secure way of `source`-ing machine-specific configs (ex: to add plugins like `parasrah/csharp.kak`
