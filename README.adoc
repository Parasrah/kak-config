Parasrah <github@parasrah.com>

== Registers

* `h`,`j`,`k`,`l`     - user
* `a`,`s`,`d`,`f`     - marks
* `^`,`x`,`z`         - selections
* `@`,`q`,`w`,`e`,`r` - macros
* `/`,`m`,`n`         - search
* `|`                 - pipe
* `1-9`               - regex matches

== Features

* `i3`
** [x] `i3-terminal-h` command to open in `i3` as hsplit
** [ ] `i3-terminal-v` command to open in `i3` as vsplit
** [x] `terminal` opens in `i3` as hsplit at bottom
** [ ] return split state to previous value after spawning new client
** [ ] allow resizing of split after
* `kitty`
** [x] scope kitty window to instance where client resides (not where kak was spawned)
** [x] allow opening program in `kitty` tab, sending edits to client (`connect.kak`)
** [x] leverage `listen_on` in config to send `kitty` commands to current client
** [x] command to open a terminal
* `fzf`
** [x] make `fzf` open in kitty window (faster than i3)
** [x] disable version control module
** [x] change `<c-w>` to delete wordwise
* `nnn`
** [x] command to open specified directory as external i3 window in `nnn` (1..1)
** [x] default above command to current buffer directory (0..1)
** [x] `-` opens `nnn` in terminal tab, goes back to kak on close
** [x] selecting file in `nnn` opens in same kakoune session
* `neovim` (make up for lacking LSP's with coc.nvim)
** [x] command to open current buffer in terminal tab, goes back to kak on close
** [x] above command opens centered on same line as kakoune
* `elm`
** [ ] remove `lsp` hack (blocked)
** [x] format
** [ ] elm-analyze
** [ ] build
* `elixir`
** [x] formatting
** [x] lsp
** [ ] lsp diagnostics
** [ ] stop lsp in insert mode?
* `csharp`
** [x] syntax files
** [x] autoindent
** [ ] comments
** [ ] build cmd
* `typescript`
** [ ] fix typescript syntax & comments
** [ ] build
** [x] lint
** [x] lsp
** [x] format
* [ ] ignore `.git` in `fzf`
* [ ] make <c-w> delete wordwise in `fzf` mode
* [ ] left margin
* [x] lsp `k` for info, `K` for diagnostics
* [ ] highlight TODO, FIXME
* [ ] replicate `R` from vim
* [ ] use `Y` for copy (not yank)
* [ ] secure way of `source`-ing machine-specific configs (ex: to add plugins like `parasrah/csharp.kak`
** this might be a cool idea for an editor agnostic tool leveraging gpg
** just a util that, given a signed file and identity, produces a list of files, would be enough
* [ ] auto-lint
* [ ] better contrast on selection?
* [ ] better insert mode indicator
* [ ] setup `gf` to work w/o file extensions for certain files
* [ ] performant way to profile startup time
* testing
** [ ] script to run kakoune (headless), check for errors, and kill
** [ ] github action leveraging above script
* [ ] don't load startup files for git?
* quickfix
** [ ] setup `toolsclient`
** [ ] keybinding to jump between
* `grep`
** [x] use `rg`
** [ ] don't require surrounding in ""
